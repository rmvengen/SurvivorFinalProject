* Survivor api = basically what I am making
* Make sure to put in detail about my Survivor api and such 
* Must have an external api (such as weather, mapping, yelp api)
* Make sure there is angular in the project


May run into a problem in the keyStore.factory.js with the URL & api keys in index.js
